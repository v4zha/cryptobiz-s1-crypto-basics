## **Problem Statement**
1. Radeesh Interupts Coversations of two Scientists Ramu and Damu , where they wish to share a secret number without radesh eavesdropping.Ramu and Damu  uses Diffie–Hellman key exchange to share the secret number.
According to them the required number is 92*[the shared secret key]+12 .
Help radeesh recover the secret number by bruteforcing the individal secret key (a,b).

2. Ramu goes to a nearby library and the librarian is frustrated with the heavy workload to verify the integrity of all sections of the library.The librarian has to verify each digital asset manually.Ramu suggests using Mirkel trees to solve the problem. What are Mirkel trees and how would it help the librarian?
